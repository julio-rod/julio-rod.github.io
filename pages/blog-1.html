            Ever since I got my hands on the new M2 MacBook Pro, I've been extremely eager to set up my portfolio website. Initially, I thought using Jekyll, a popular static site generator, with a pre-built site template would be the easiest route. I soon discovered that this wasn't going to be as straightforward as I had imagined.

        The first obstacle I encountered was getting Jekyll to work on my M2 Mac. The M2 chips are based on ARM architecture, which differs significantly from the Intel chips that most software, including Jekyll, are optimized for. As a result, running Jekyll natively on the M2 MacBook Pro presented some unexpected issues.
    
        Despite my best efforts to troubleshoot, I was confronted with an array of confusing error messages. I tried various solutions I found on community forums and StackOverflow, such as using Rosetta 2 to translate the Intel-based applications to work with the ARM architecture, but to no avail. It was a frustrating process that felt like I was trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.
    
        It was during this time that I realized I was spending more time trying to fix Jekyll installation issues than I would have spent building a site from scratch. This revelation was a turning point. I decided to pivot and take on the challenge of developing my website from the ground up.
    
        The shift from using a pre-built template to crafting a site from scratch wasn't easy. There was a significant learning curve, but I was prepared to tackle it head-on. I was a bit familiar with HTML and CSS, but I soon found out that there was so much more to learn. I spent hours each day learning about CSS positioning, font-face rules, how to include different font types and even how to incorporate interactive JavaScript elements into my site.
    
        Developing my website from scratch also meant I had to figure out how to set up a structure for the pages and how to link them together. This was especially important as I needed a home page, a portfolio page, and a blog page with several linked blog posts.
    
        In addition to the structure and layout, I had to get creative with the aesthetics of the site. This included choosing background colors, selecting appropriate fonts, positioning text and buttons, and even adding images with adjustable dimensions.
    
        What made the process challenging but also incredibly rewarding was the level of customization and personal touch I could add to my website. Instead of relying on a pre-built template, every aspect of the site, from the font to the footer, was crafted with my personal touch. Despite the initial hiccups and steep learning curve, I was able to learn valuable skills and build a portfolio site that truly represents me.
    
        Through this journey, I learned that sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to take a step back and consider alternative paths. While using Jekyll and a pre-built template seemed like the easier route, developing my site from scratch turned out to be a far more enriching and rewarding experience.
    
        In conclusion, the journey to create my portfolio website on my M2 MacBook Pro was full of unexpected challenges and hurdles. But with each problem I faced, I also found new opportunities for learning and growth. Today, I'm not just the proud owner of a new M2 MacBook Pro, but also a custom-built portfolio site that's truly mine.
    
        This experience has taught me that the road less traveled often leads to greater learning and satisfaction. It's a lesson I'll carry forward into my future projects. And who knows? The next time I face a technical challenge, I might just choose to build from scratch again!
