    <!-- <p id="bio">Hello! I'm Julio Rodvilla, a passionate software developer with a special interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My journey in the tech field began with a strong foundation in computer science, and from there, I've loved diving headfirst into complex problems to find innovative solutions.

      I've never been one to shy away from a challenge - in fact, the more intricate the problem, the more I enjoy the process. This passion drives my continuous learning, and I'm always ready to explore new technologies and tools.
      
      But I'm not all about work! In my spare time, you might catch me coding for fun, staying updated with the latest tech trends, or immersing myself in the world of retro video games. I also love the outdoors - exploring nature trails and trekking in mountains are some of my favorite ways to unwind. Nice to meet you!</p> -->
